These are some projects of mine. 

# Eliza
This project was created with some help from ChatGPT.

# Spin it up
## Run locally
Run a local web server to view the page.
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Run it online
Note: must setup ngrok account and domain. https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/ 
```
ngrok http 8080 --url $YOUR_DOMAIN
```

# Future Improvements
Look into natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy for Eliza 2.0 implementation.
